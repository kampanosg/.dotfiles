# nvim-config
Welcome to my NeoVim configuration repo! Mainly storing it here so that I don't lose it but also to be able to roll-back whenever I break it ðŸ˜….

It can be cloned directly into `~/.config/` and then renamed to `nvim`. [Packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim), is also required for plugin management. 

Run `:PackerSync` to pull the plugins.

Export the following env variable to get the fuzzy finder to include `dotfiles` but not hidden dirs (e.g `.git/`)

```
95  export FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND="find . -path '*/\.*' -type d -prune -o -type f -print

```

Other dependencies:
* `brew install the_silver_searcher`
