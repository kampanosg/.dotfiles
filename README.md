# .dotfiles
Welcome to my .dotfiles repository on GitHub 👨‍💻⚙️

This repository contains all of my configuration files for various programs and tools that I use for day to day dev. It also serves as a backup for when I mess up.

Each dir contains a `README` file with usage instructions, so feel free to use them if you find them useful.
