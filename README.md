# nvim-config
My NeoVim configuration! Mainly storing it here so that I don't lose it but also be able to roll-back whenever I break it ðŸ˜….

It can be cloned directly into `~/.config/nvim`. [Packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim), is also required for plugin management. 

Run `:PackerSync` to pull the plugins.
