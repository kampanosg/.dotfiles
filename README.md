# NeoVim Configuration
This is my NeoVim configuration! I primarily use it for daily Go and Rust development.

Mainly storing it here so that I don't lose it and be able to roll-back whenever I break it ðŸ˜….

It can be cloned directly into `~/.config/` and then renamed to `nvim`. [Packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim), is also required for plugin management. 

## Dependencies

Run `:PackerSync` to pull the plugins.
The following `Mason` packages are also required (Install with `:MasonInstall`
* `gopls`
* `rust-analyzer`
* `lua-language-server`
* `codelldb`
* `cpptools`
