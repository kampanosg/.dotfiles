# .dotfiles
Welcome to my .dotfiles repository on GitHub 👨‍💻⚙️

This repository contains all of my configuration files for various programs and tools that I use for day to day dev. It also serves as a backup for when I mess up.

## Usage
This repo can be cloned directly into the user's home directory (`~/`) and renamed to `.config`. Each program should be able to pickup the settings.

For `tmux`, the config file has to be coppied to the user's home directory.
