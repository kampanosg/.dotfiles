# Hyper Configuration
This is my [Hyper](https://hyper.is/) configuration! I have been using this term on and off the past few months, so I am storing the config here so that I don't have to set it up everytime 🤷‍♀️.

## Usage
Clone the config file in the `$HOME` directory and start the app. The term should auto install all the required plugins and themes.

Note: _Hyper needs `npm` to install plugins_
