# NeoVim Configuration
This is my NeoVim configuration! I primarily use it for daily Go and Rust development and storing it to roll back to it when I break it ðŸ˜…. 

I aim to use as few plugins as possible and use a lot of default vim functionality. For example, I don't have buffer lines, sidebars etc. It can be cloned directly into `~/.config/` and Lazy should do the rest
