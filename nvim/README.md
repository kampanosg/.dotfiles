# NeoVim Configuration
This is my NeoVim configuration! I primarily use it for my day-to-day Go and Rust development.

Mainly storing it here so that I don't lose it and be able to roll-back whenever I break it ðŸ˜….

## Usage 
The repo can be cloned directly into `~/.config/` and then renamed to `nvim`. 

Plugins are managed via [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) which bootstraps itself. LSP is managed by [lsp-zero](https://github.com/VonHeikemen/lsp-zero.nvim) and [Mason](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim)
